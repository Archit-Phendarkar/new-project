            <p>Toy Story is a 1995 computer-animated film about a boy named Andy and his toys that come to life when
                he's not around. The movie is about the conflict between Andy's favorite toy, Woody, and the new toy he
                receives for his birthday, Buzz Lightyear. Andy is a 6-year-old boy who loves playing with his toys,
                including Woody, a cowboy doll, and Rex, a plastic dinosaur. </p>
